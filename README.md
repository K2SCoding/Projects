# About Me:

Hi there! üëã I'm K2!
üîß Mechanical Engineer | üìä Data Analyst | üéÆ Game Enthusiast
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a mechanical engineer who believes that data-driven decision making and creative problem-solving go hand in hand. I transform complex engineering data into actionable insights while building engaging digital experiences that make technology more accessible and fun.

üöÄ What I'm Currently Working On

Data Analytics Projects: Building comprehensive dashboards and analytics solutions using Snowflake, PowerBI, and MySQL to solve real-world mechanical engineering challenges
Game Development: Creating interactive web-based games including a classic Ludo implementation and an ambitious multiplayer Quidditch Manager platform
Learning Journey: Continuously expanding my skills in cloud data warehousing, advanced visualization techniques, and full-stack web development

üí° My Approach
I believe that the best solutions come from combining analytical rigor with creative thinking. Whether I'm optimizing manufacturing processes through data analysis or designing game mechanics that engage players, I apply the same systematic problem-solving approach that mechanical engineering has taught me.
My projects demonstrate how skills from different domains can complement each other. The database design principles I use in my Quidditch Manager game directly apply to engineering data warehousing. The statistical analysis techniques I employ in manufacturing optimization also help me balance game mechanics for fair and engaging gameplay.

üå± Learning Philosophy
I approach every project as a learning opportunity. My repositories document not just the final solutions, but the thought processes, challenges encountered, and lessons learned along the way. I believe that sharing knowledge strengthens the entire community, which is why I emphasize comprehensive documentation and clear explanations in all my work.
Each project builds upon previous learning while introducing new concepts. My data analysis projects inform better game balancing decisions, while my game development work helps me create more engaging data visualization interfaces.

üé® When I'm Not Coding
I'm passionate about finding creative solutions to complex problems, whether that's designing more efficient mechanical systems, creating engaging game experiences, or finding new ways to visualize data that tells compelling stories. I enjoy exploring how principles from different fields can inform and improve each other.
